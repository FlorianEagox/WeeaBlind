Dialogue: 5,0:04:20.82,0:04:21.86,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,What were you thinking?
Dialogue: 5,0:04:21.86,0:04:23.78,Main02,,0,0,0,,So many things had disappeared before me,

Dialogue: 5,0:04:26.42,0:04:27.91,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,Your reasoning is seriously flawed.
Dialogue: 5,0:04:27.91,0:04:30.41,Main02,,0,0,0,,So I turned down my new job offer,
Dialogue: 5,0:04:30.41,0:04:32.41,Main02,,0,0,0,,and debuted on the street as an illusionist!
Dialogue: 5,0:04:32.41,0:04:33.71,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,Again, what were you thinking?
Dialogue: 5,0:04:33.71,0:04:37.28,Main02,,0,0,0,,If I save up 1.2 million yen with my shows and buy the magic body sawing box,
Dialogue: 5,0:04:37.28,0:04:38.96,Main02,,0,0,0,,my wife will definitely take me back!

Dialogue: 5,0:04:39.80,0:04:41.89,Main02,,0,0,0,,Maybe I made the wrong choice after all.
Dialogue: 5,0:04:41.89,0:04:43.22,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,Talk about getting off track.
Dialogue: 5,0:04:43.22,0:04:45.30,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,He should quit this illusionist stint and get a real job.
Dialogue: 5,0:04:45.30,0:04:47.35,Main02,,0,0,0,,Oops. Sorry for all the gloomy talk.
Dialogue: 5,0:04:47.35,0:04:48.92,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,But what would convince him to quit?
Dialogue: 5,0:04:48.92,0:04:51.28,Main02,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah! You want to be an illusionist too, right?
Dialogue: 5,0:04:51.28,0:04:52.52,Main02,,0,0,0,,Want me to judge your technique?
Dialogue: 5,0:04:52.52,0:04:53.02,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,That's it!
Dialogue: 5,0:04:53.52,0:04:55.39,Main02,,0,0,0,,Ooh. You're going to pull something out of your bag?
Dialogue: 5,0:04:55.39,0:04:59.65,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,If I show the gulf between our skills with an incredible illusion, he'll likely drop his act.

Dialogue: 5,0:06:11.68,0:06:13.31,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,This is hard to believe, though.
Dialogue: 5,0:06:13.31,0:06:15.47,Main02 ita,,0,0,0,,When I first met him, he almost killed his dove.
