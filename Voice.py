Meanwhile, the dog, relaxed and unperturbed, watches with half-closed eyes, acknowledging the fox's spirited display. The surrounding nature seems to hold its breath, enchanted by this charming spectacle. The gentle rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds provide a soothing soundtrack to this magical moment. The two animals, one lively and the other laid-back, showcase the beautiful harmony of nature, an ageless dance that continues to mesmerize all who witness it."

And... now I imagine you'll... shut it down. Move on with your life. Onwards and upwards, ay Gordon? I don't.. know... how much longer I have to send this to you so I'll try to keep it brief. Not my specialty. Perhaps this is presumptuous of me but... Must this really be the end of our time together? Perhaps you could take the science team's data, transfer us somewhere else, hmm? Now... it doesn't have to be Super Punch-Out for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Maybe a USB drive, or a spare floppy disk. You could take us with you! We could see the world! We could... I'm getting a little ahead of myself, surely. Welp! The option's always there! You changed our lives, Gordon. I'd like to think it was for the better. And I don't know what's going to happen to us once you exit the game for good. But I know we'll never forget you. I hope you won't forget us. Well... This is where I get off. Goodbye Gordon!"
